# SomeContract README

## Overview

`SomeContract` is a smart contract developed in the Move programming language for deployment on the Move Virtual Machine (VM). This contract introduces a structured approach to managing data and functionalities, featuring a struct named `SomeStruct` and a resource called `SomeResource`, alongside various functions and variables with different accessibility levels.

### Features

- **SomeStruct**: A public struct with variables and functions that range in accessibility from public to self-restricted.
  - **Variables**:
    - `a`: A string variable, publicly settable.
    - `b`: A string variable, publicly readable.
    - `c`: A string variable, restricted to the contract.
    - `d`: A string variable, restricted to self.
  - **Functions**:
    - `publicFunc()`: Publicly accessible function.
    - `contractFunc()`: Contract-restricted function.
    - `privateFunc()`: Self-restricted function.
    - `structFunc()`: A public function within the struct.

- **SomeResource**: A resource with a variable and a function designed for specific uses.
  - **Variable**:
    - `e`: An integer variable, publicly accessible.
  - **Function**:
    - `resourceFunc()`: A function associated with the resource.

### Initialization

- The `SomeStruct` is initialized with default values for its variables in the contract's `init()` function.
- The `SomeResource` is also initialized with a default value in its own `init()` function.

## Public Functions

- `createSomeResource()`: Creates and returns an instance of `SomeResource`.
- `questsAreFun()`: Executes predefined fun quests.

## Main Module

The main module integrates `SomeContract`, facilitating interactions with the contract's functionalities through a `main()` function.

## Usage

1. Deploy `SomeContract` onto the Move Virtual Machine.
2. Utilize the `createSomeResource()` function to instantiate `SomeResource`.
3. Call `questsAreFun()` to engage in fun quests.
4. Explore additional functionalities as desired.

## Dependencies

- This contract requires the `SomeContract` module available at address `0x05`.

## Areas Marked

- **AREA 1**: Location of `structFunc()` within `SomeStruct`.
- **AREA 2**: Location of `resourceFunc()` within `SomeResource`.
- **AREA 3**: Location of `questsAreFun()` within the contract.
- **AREA 4**: The main function within the main module for executing contract functionalities.
